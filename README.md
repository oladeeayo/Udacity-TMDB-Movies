# Udacity-TMDB-Movies
I will be using the TMDb Movies Dataset to complete this data analysis project. This dataset contains data on various movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), with information which includes cast, director, movie budgets, users rating, movie revenues among other things.

My goal with this project is to use my understanding of data analytics to provide interesting facts and insights about the movie industry using this dataset.

**Questions**
Here are some of the interesting questions I intended to use this dataset to answer:

The average movie runtime
The Top movies by profit
The Most and Least Profitable Movie
The movies profit per year
The number of movies released per year
The number of movies released per Genre
